Basically maintains lightweight cache of registered angular names
to prevent collision. Any attempt to override existing module / controller / filter / service
results in an exception with details. Make sure to use function names when
registering modules to get meaningful stack for easier debugging.
This script is good for debugging environment, probably not necessary to run
in production.

Namespacing other conventions are good practice, but not really
enforceable 100%, so I created this script. It prevents run-time overriding via these calls

* angular.module
* angular.filter (across all filter names)
* angular.controller (across all controller names)
  * for now works with array format `.controller('foo', ['dep1', 'dep2', ..., fn]);`
* angular.service (across all service names)
  * service names are checked for all functions that create services (service, factory, provider, value)
* angular.factory (across all service names)
* angular.provider (across all service names)
* angular.value (across all service names)
* angular.directive (across all directive names)

## Overriding entities in Angular

The overriding situation in Angular becomes terrible and hair-pulling as soon as you
have several people working on the same web app. Name clashes can happen anywhere
and result in silent and very non-obvious failures. Here is an example where the
second module with the same name wins:

```js
angular.module('A', [])
.directive('aDirective', function () {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    template: '<div>module A: a-directive</div>'
  };
}).filter('F', function () {
  return function () { return 'F'; };
});

angular.module('A', [])
}).filter('F', function () {
  return function () { return 'F2'; };
});
```

Last registered entity with same name wins. In this case, second module with
name A and filter F wins. To avoid the situation, we can change each module to
have a different name. What about filters? They can clash across modules!
This might be a design decision (allows overriding logic based on the closes module),
but definitely causes weird behavior:

```js
angular.module('A', [])
.directive('aDirective', function () {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    template: '<div>module A: a-directive, filter result {{ 22 | F }}</div>'
  };
}).filter('F', function () {
  return function () { return 'F'; };
});

angular.module('A2', [])
.controller('A2Ctrl', function () {})
.filter('F', function () {
  return function () { return 'F2'; };
});
```

Module A includes a directive which uses filter F. Second module A2
includes a controller and also a filter with name F. Which filter would be
used in side the `<a-directive>`? Depends on which controller is closest!

```html
<div ng-controller="A2Ctrl">
  <a-directive></a-directive>
</div>
```

`module A: a-directive, filter result F2`

Even creating a controller for the `a-directive` does not help, the second
unrelated module wins just because it surrounds the element on the page. Madness.

## Unit testing

I unit tested the script using browser simulation under Nodejs.
See my [blog post](http://glebbahmutov.com/blog/unit-testing-angular-load-using-node/)
and [test.js](test/test.js)
